#### Data

This app uses 3 different data set : *coast_vs_waste.csv*, *mismanaged_vs_gdp.csv* and *waste_vs_gdp.csv* which can be found at [TidyTuesday](https://github.com/rfordatascience/tidytuesday/tree/master/data/2019/2019-05-21#coast_vs_wastecsv). 

The dataset named *coast_vs_waste* provides a yearly approximation of plastic discharge. The overall count for a nation does not encompass waste that is sent abroad and could have a greater likelihood of finding its way into the ocean.

The dataset labeled *waste_vs_gdp.csv* contains information on the daily amount of plastic waste generated per individual, quantified in kilograms per person per day. This measurement reflects the general rate of per capita plastic waste production before considering waste management, recycling, or incineration. Consequently, this measurement does not directly signify the potential risk of polluting waterways or marine environments.

Lastly, in the *waste_vs_gdp.csv* dataset, mismanaged plastic waste refers to plastic that's either littered or not disposed of properly. The total for a country doesn't count waste that's shipped overseas, where it might also not be managed well.

#### Purpose

The purpose of the app is to:

1. Raise awareness of plastic pollution.
2. Put into perspective the magnitude of waste produced by each person per day. 
3. Promote discussions about effective waste management policies.
